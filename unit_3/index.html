		<h3>The Bucket List</h3>
		<p>Travel has always been on the agenda. They say it takes around 10 days to truly feel the benefits of a holiday. In Australia we have 4 weeks of holiday up our sleeve every year, some companies will also let you take unpaid leave and buy back extra time. Its not uncommon to take a 6 week holiday. I haven't taken a holiday like this in some time but am starting to feel the need to. At Christmas time we have forced office shutdown. Australia is in full blown holiday mode, for around 2 weeks, unless you're working in retail. There are a number of public holidays at that time so we end up using only a few actual accrued holidays.  The plan this year is to camp by the beach for a few days, then come home and veg and go to the beach most days. I can't wait. Its not the holiday of my dreams. Greece is. Greece isn't in the budget just yet though, paying off debt and accruing some time of fallback safe fund is. Until that time, we live in a beautiful area and I'm determined to feel content and just enjoy what we have.</p>
